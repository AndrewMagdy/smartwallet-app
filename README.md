git-flow
--------
We are using git-flow to manage our branching strategy. More details can be found in [this article](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). Also, you should install a plugin for your git command line: [nvie/gitflow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow).

Once you have installed the git flow plugin, you should initialize its branch mappings with this command:
```bash
git flow init -d
```
